# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

> This is a project built off a social media scaffold. In this project we implemented the relationship between uses among other functionalities

We added some functionalities like making a user able to send friendship request. The receiver of the request can accept or reject the request.

The logged in user can only see the posts made by themself or their friends.
